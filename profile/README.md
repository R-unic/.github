## Other Compilers
- [Wasynth](https://github.com/Rerumu/Wasynth):
WASM -> Luau, not very performant but good for a Proof of Concept.
- [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com):
TS -> Luau, Very good Typescript to Luau compiler with many features.
- [roblox-rs](https://github.com/roblox-rs):
Rust bindings for Roblox STD, should be used with Wasynth.
